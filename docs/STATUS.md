# Status — October 27, 2026

Widening SIMD products/accumulation and ABI v8 multiple-register structure transport are implemented and tested; automatic source-only publication and periodic continuations remain active. **No game-derived function has executed. Mario Kart World has not booted, rendered or become playable.**

## Latest implementation

- Added SMULL/UMULL, SMLAL/UMLAL and SMLSL/UMLSL for B/H/S inputs, low/upper source halves and H/S indexed-element forms. Full snapshots preserve aliases/V31 and unsigned modulo arithmetic defines accumulator wrap without signed overflow. These operations preserve NZCV/FPCR/FPSR and require no callbacks or ABI changes.
- Independent i128 expectations check 280,800 native cases per optimization. The 187,200-case synthetic QEMU matrix matches O0/O2 with fatal UBSan, including extrema, upper halves, all indexed lanes, source/destination aliases and accumulator wrap.
- The supplied-binary survey accepts three further extents containing widening products and compiles two additional representative objects. SMULL no longer appears among first blockers; newly exposed SQADD now accounts for 39 extents. Counts reflect static indexed extent coverage, not execution frequency.
- ABI v8 and complete multiple-register LD1–LD4/ST1–ST4 transport were validated and published as `85d077a`. No new upstream sources were added. README, game inputs/generated code, credentials and private artifacts remain excluded from GitHub.

## Supplied-binary evidence

All **223,856 indexed CIE/FDE extents** validate. The survey lowers **213,980 indexed extents**, including **126,757 with PAC operations**, up from 213,977 under the same tail policy. **38 accepted extents contain contiguous LD1 lists and 61 contain LD3/LD4 interleaving** (categories overlap). **58,448 contain direct extent tails; 14,137 contain indirect BR** (categories overlap). Configuration/helpers/callees/targets remain incomplete or unbound; these are not runnable-function or full-module counts. **Ninety-three representative game-derived samples compile into native objects, 61 with PAC; none execute.**

Native samples now have a 4,096-instruction representative limit. One oversized candidate is explicitly deferred; every observed feature still has a compiled representative in its module. These object counts use the new sampling policy and are not directly comparable with prior first-feature selections.

The existing exact-version diagnostic still applies and reads back **309,844 relocations** across four modules / 79,721,040 mapped bytes, with 26,110 named symbol bindings. Symbol search uses validated SONAME dependencies and an explicit process policy inferred statically from the supplied rtld. Actual retail address layout/startup has not been reproduced.

## Validation

- **164 Rust tests pass**, including extended memory capacity, multiple structures and stale-ABI refusal checks and earlier scaled conversion/rounding/integer SIMD/FP/memory semantics, plus all prior native thread-register, bit/carry, conversion, FP, SIMD, LSE, PAC and control-flow regressions.
- **187,200 widening multiply/accumulate fixtures** match QEMU at O0/O2; independent i128 expectations check 280,800 native cases per optimization across signed/unsigned register/indexed inputs, low/upper halves and accumulator wrap.
- **270,144 SQDMULH/SQRDMULH fixtures** match QEMU at O0/O2; independent i128 product/round/clamp expectations check 405,216 native cases per optimization, including H/S scalar/vector and all indexed lanes, minimum-value saturation and sticky QC.
- **448 SHRN/SHRN2 fixtures** match QEMU at O0/O2; independent byte-to-u128 division expectations check 114,688 native cases per optimization, with every legal amount, aliases, retained/cleared halves and QC preservation.
- **24 raw narrowing fixtures** match QEMU at O0/O2; independent byte-array expectations check 6,144 native cases per optimization, including retained/cleared halves and V31 aliases.
- **64 transform and 34,320 immediate/widening shift fixtures** match QEMU at O0/O2. Independent native oracles cover 16,384 and 68,640 cases per optimization respectively, including all legal amounts, aliases, full-width shifts and upper clearing.
- **327,680 scaled-conversion fixtures** match QEMU at O0/O2 and independent native rational expectations. A separate 98,304-case helper matrix checks exact arithmetic and flags per optimization; malformed-operation and AOT refusal/zero-register tests remain mandatory.
- **22,960 integral-rounding fixtures** match QEMU at O0/O2. Independent native rounding/NaN/flag expectations cover 45,920 cases per optimization, including FRINTX inexact behavior and suppressed IXC in other forms.
- **24,864 integer SIMD fixtures** match QEMU at O0/O2. Independent i128/u128 native oracles check 41,280 cases per optimization, including all-lane extrema, aliases, wrap and widened sums.
- **120 table/count fixtures** match QEMU at O0/O2. Independent native byte-sequence/popcount tests cover 34,816 cases per optimization, including every byte/index value, table wrapping, aliases and upper clearing.
- **16,800 SIMD FP comparison fixtures** match QEMU at O0/O2 across S/D, scalar/vector arrangements, aliases, NaNs, signed zeros, controls and compare-zero forms. Mandatory native tests independently compare ordered inputs and NaN/exception expectations.
- **2,120 complete multiple-structure fixtures** match QEMU at O0/O2, with 6,360 independent native success cases and 10,600 fault/permission cases per optimization. Extended bridge widths, short buffers, bad sizes and stale entry/helper versions also reject as required.
- **280 interleaved LD2/ST2 fixtures** match QEMU at O0/O2. Independent native byte-array checks cover 840 successful and 1,400 fault/permission cases per optimization; callback probes additionally verify one complete access and no partial register/base commit.
- **1,088 single-structure memory fixtures** match QEMU at O0/O2. Independent native byte-array cases additionally cover unsigned post-index wrap, aliasing, faults and complete memory/register preservation.
- **210 permutation fixtures** match QEMU at O0/O2; independent native lane-sequence tests cover 8,064 cases per optimization, including aliasing and upper clearing.
- **8,768 S/D format-conversion fixtures** and **40 CRC fixtures** match QEMU at O0/O2. Native CRC tests independently use polynomial division and standard string check values.
- **86,304 SIMD numeric fixtures** match QEMU at O0/O2, covering lane selection/arrangements, overlapping sources/destinations, rounding/default-NaN controls and sticky FPSR.
- **7,232 conversion fixtures** match QEMU 8.2.2 at native O0/O2 with fatal UBSan, checking vector/general-register results, FPSR, NZCV and FPCR across W/X and S/D, controls, integer boundaries, fractions, signed zeros, infinities and quiet/signaling NaNs.
- The expanded **26,416 FP/selection fixtures** also match QEMU at O0/O2. Earlier **2,741 SIMD**, **160 LSE** and **4,096 QARMA5** software comparisons remain passing. QEMU shares broad SoftFloat lineage and is not a hardware oracle; optional unavailability is explicitly recorded.
- **141,072 constructed encodings**, including **60,721 accepted encodings**, pass private Capstone family/width/immediate checks. This checks decoding, not runtime semantics or hardware behavior.
- Native semantic cases run at O0/O2 with fatal undefined-behavior instrumentation. Synthetic programs only are executed; native game sample objects are compilation evidence.
- **4,096 independent QARMA5 comparisons pass** against privately compiled QEMU reference code. The game's PAC profile is still unverified. The legacy/QARMA5/39-bit/no-TBI backend remains diagnostic and selected only by synthetic tests.
- Formatting, Clippy with warnings denied, exact ExeFS/segment hashes, changed-identity refusal and truncated-CFG refusal pass. Public artifact checks exclude original inputs and all generated/private data.
- Reproduction: `python3 tools/validate.py --game base`. Actual outputs are in `private/testing/validation.json`. Optional `tools/classify_survey.py` uses private Capstone to classify first blockers per indexed function; those counts are not execution frequencies.

## Input investigation retained

205,781 RomFS files / 23,278,867,417 bytes were inventoried, including 121 listings. All 205,787 listed entries match presence/sizes. Deep payload inspection remains sampled/bounded. Retail version and complete retail content remain unverified; SDK markers are not a retail version mapping. Original inputs were not modified. No original-hardware oracle, Vulkan/SDL3, RADV, audio/input or gameplay validation exists.

## Milestones

| Phase | Classification | Remaining work |
|---|---|---|
| 0 investigation | Partially implemented | Retail version/completeness, graphics/resource analysis |
| 1 foundation | Partially implemented | Synthetic native/Rust bridges pass; ISA and runtime semantics incomplete |
| 2 game CPU translation | Partially implemented | 213,980 subset-liftable indexed extents with possible unbound tails/profiles; 93 objects; no complete module |
| 3 runtime bootstrap | Not started | Load-time linking passes; no actual game execution/startup |
| 4–8 graphics through packaging | Not started | No genuine game frame, native input/audio or gameplay |

## Files changed this session

Widening multiply IR/decoder/emitter; independent i128 and synthetic QEMU semantic matrices; survey feature and Capstone metadata; CPU/compatibility/research/status documentation. CPU ABI v8 and upstream sources are unchanged. Original inputs remain unchanged and all game-derived outputs stay private.

## Next concrete dependencies

The leading first blockers now include UDF (457 extents), undecoded (122), SVC (79), LDAXR (60), SQADD (39), FRECPE (32), MRS (28), FRSQRTE (26), SQXTUN (24), USHL (21) and UADDW (19). Counts are first blockers, not dynamic frequencies. Next add validated saturating add/subtract and narrowing/register-shift operations and multi-register lane/replication forms. Reciprocal estimates need exact architectural approximation/exception semantics. Exclusive monitors need a defined concurrency model; existing serialized memory support does not imply hardware transaction equivalence. UDF/undecoded words and unresolved CFG edges require investigation; SVC requires actual service ABI work. Target cache/counter/PAC/FP/address configuration, SP/access-trap policies, TLS templates/allocation, actual guest threading, indirect binding and bootstrap/services remain gates before original execution.
